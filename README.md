Sentiment analysis is essential for understanding user feedback on applications. IndoBERT stands out as a leading model due to its ability to deeply understand text context. This study analyzes the latest version of the Signal â€“ Samsat Digital Nasional application, a public service app for online motor vehicle tax payments. The IndoBERT model was optimized using Optuna hyperparameter tuning, which proved to be more efficient compared to Random Search or Grid Search. Additionally, approaches to handling imbalanced data were employed using oversampling technique such as SMOTE, K-Means SMOTE, and ADASYN. The best sentiment analysis results were achieved using IndoBERT with K-Means SMOTE for imbalanced data handling, yielding a balanced accuracy of 0,7623, macro f1-score of 0,7846. This combination improves balanced accuracy by up to 6% and macro f1-score by up to 4% compared to the baseline model without imbalance handling. These results highlight that K-Means SMOTE is the most effective technique among the tested methods for improving model performance in multiclass sentiment classification tasks with imbalanced data.
